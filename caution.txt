CAUTION: Long distance travel using enderpearl nether trick 
has one fatal flaw: It doesn't guarantee if you will be teleported
to a safe block, Ie you might outright tp into lava and lose all
your gears, So always have fire resistance buff to save yourself!

ALSO You might as well drop to thousand blocks after tp, so better
take totems while proceeding, Using this trick without totem is
suicidal! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!

This is very risky mode of travel, but with sufficientpreparation,
It's quite good :)!!
